src/app/page.tsx
revalidate = 0 has same effect as no-cache

router.refresh() - revalidates data on the route. But when we're on the different route the data is not refreshed for the other routes.
We can specify to not prefetch data for the affected routes, this way it will be fetched every time.
setting no-prefetch src/app/components/NavBat.tsx (which of course doesn't work, so I added router.refresh() in AddTodo.tsx on submit form instead)

soft vs hard navigation. Soft - cache persists. Hard - cache invalidated.

All these things are fairly new/unstable. Check before you wreck.
